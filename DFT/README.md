### Task:
1. Write a program that calculates the direct and inverse Fourier transform, use the discrete Fourier transform formula.
2. Write a program that compares your Fourier transform and the result of fast Fourier transform from any open library on various signals:
- harmonic signal,
- random noise,
- square wave,
- the sum of two harmonic functions with different frequencies and amplitudes.
3. Show the result of calculating the Fourier transform graphically.
