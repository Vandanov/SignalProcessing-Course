### Task:
Assume there are some function. For example a semicircle, let's define it from 0 to 1.
First, we will reflect it in an even way. See how it converges (transform it in a Fourier series, find a_k and b_k).
Then we reflect the odd one and see how the picture has changed. For different k, and explore it.
Then modified by substract linear part and expore result.
### Result:
